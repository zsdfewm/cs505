The makefile is included, use "make" to compiler the .class files. We made some changes on the channel level implementation. Please refer "edu/purdue/cs505/TestBroadcastA.java", "edu/purdue/cs505/TestBroadcastB.java", "edu/purdue/cs505/TestBroadcastC.java" for example tests. 

Because the underlying channel is FIFO reliable, so there is no much different if reliablebroadcast and FIFO reliablebroadcast in our implementation. 

Please Use Broadcast.java implements FIFOReliableBroadcast for (FIFO)reliableboradcast.
And use FIFOBroadcast.java implements FIFOReliableBroadcast for FIFO or FIFO-SRB broadcast.
